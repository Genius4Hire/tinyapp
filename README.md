# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).


## Dependencies

- Node.js
- Express
- EJS
- bcryptjs
- cookie-session

## Getting Started

- Install all dependencies (using the `npm install` command).
- Run the development web server using the `node express_server.js` command.

## Notes:
- Some routes lead to a simple redirect, only a message and a link, but will forward the user to the correct place.
- Further cosmetics could be applied, but functionality was more important.
